# rock-paper-scissors
[Live Demo](https://faithd186.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Initially, the game was coded such that it could only be played from the console. After learning more about Javascript fundamentals, I created a simple UI for the game. This required some refactoring of the code so that it would work with the DOM model, as well as required the use DOM methods to respond to user events and to show responsive contents on the webpage. Overall, this project gave me the opportunity to apply knowledge of Javascript basics to code a simple game with a UI.
