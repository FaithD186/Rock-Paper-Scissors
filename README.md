# rock-paper-scissors
[Live Demo](https://faithd186.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game made with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Initially, the game could only be played in the console (see r-p-s.html). Then, a simple UI for the game was created using Javascript. This project used DOM manipulation and methods to construct the UI.
